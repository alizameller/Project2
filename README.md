# Computer Architecture ECE251 Project 2
## Purpose / Goal
- Read file that contains a list of numbers (One number per line - limited to 32 bits; Line terminated by '\n'
- Create another file that has the numbers in ascending order

Usage: Sort linefeed delimited numbers in a file in ascending order then output to a file

Example: 
- input.txt output.txt 
It is also possible to replace the file with the sorted version: 
- numbers.txt numbers.txt

```
2. Download the Makefile from GitHub using curl: 
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alizameller/Project2/main/Makefile --output Makefile
```
3. Run the Makefile in the directory downloaded: 
```bash
make
```
4. Run the exectutable generated followed by the input and output file names:
